            <h1>Forever Evolving</h1>
            <p>I, Omari G., am a young ambitious producer and creative director with an extensive background in photography, film, scripted series, broadcast, and marketing. Born and raised in the Virgin Islands, I found myself in New York City, where I had the opportunity to earn my Bachelors in Film and Television at St. John’s University. During my college career, I have completed internships at the Virgin Islands Public Broadcasting System (PBS), Viya, and Matte Projects based in New York.</p>
            <p>With over 5 years of filmmaking experience, I’ve come to adore the art of storytelling and being able to bring life to distinct imagination that hold its own unique value. I believe that stories are what connect people and inspire them to see outside of their normal perspective of every day life.</p>
            <p>I am determined to use the art of storytelling through different mediums, such as film, television, and photography, to spread positive messages, in hopes to encourage and inspire people to live as their most authentic selves.</p>
